# Contributing

To contribute to this repository, you must create a fork and push commits there first before raising a pull request. 

## Commit Requirements

- All non-merging commits shall abide by the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

## Pull Request Requirements

1. Ensure that build dependencies are removed or ignored by git.
2. Ensure that there is no private or sensitive information in the code or other files, such as .env files.
3. All pull requests from forks **must** go to the ``dev`` branch. From the ``dev`` branch, the developer team will periodically validate all functionality before internally pull requesting to ``main``. Any and all other pull requests will be denied.
